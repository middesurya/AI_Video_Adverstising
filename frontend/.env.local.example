# AI Video Advertising - Frontend Configuration
# ===========================

# ===== Supabase Configuration =====
# Get these from: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
# IMPORTANT: Use the "anon" (public) key here, NOT the service role key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key-here

# ===== Backend API Configuration =====
# Development: http://localhost:8002
# Production: https://your-backend-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8002

# ===== Notes =====
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
# 2. NEVER commit .env.local to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 3. Only use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for values that should be exposed to the browser
# 4. The anon key is safe to expose in the browser (it has Row Level Security)
# 5. NEVER expose the service role key in frontend environment variables
